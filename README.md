**My First Chatbot**

My firts chatbot using Gemini AI model. This chatbot uses conversation history to capture what was said. Only capable of doing regular chats, and does not yet use data sources as a knowledge base. As a starting practice, this is already better.

**How to use:**
- Install all libraries in requirements.txt
- Copy chatbot_app.py
- Run in your local terminal or Streamlit
